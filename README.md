# OpenESEF
Open source implementation of ESEF-Parser/Analysor/Validator in Java/Kotlin

## Cause
Recently, I searched for a reliable open-source solution for the [ESEF](https://www.esma.europa.eu/document/esma-esef-taxonomy-2021) and I was totally suprised by the action of German software-Vendors who unanimously made their open-sourced xbrl-solution completely proprietary.   

What a fking blunt violation of the open-source spirit! 

## Roadmap
1. Parser and presentation of 2021 financial statement of Top-5 DAX-Companies 
2. ESEF-Analysor and Validator
3. ESEF-Generator
